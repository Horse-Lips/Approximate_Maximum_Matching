Summer research project at the University of Glasgow. The aim of the project was to approximate maximum matchings using Edmond's blossom algorithm on a modified graph. The graph would be modified in order to bound the degree of vertices to 3 and to remove all k- and k-double-stars before partitioning the graph and carrying out a search for maximum matchings in each partition. Unfortunately there was not enough time to carry out any experimentation. A report is included which details the completed work.
