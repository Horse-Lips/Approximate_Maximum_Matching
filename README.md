Summer research internship university project. Attempting to approximate maximum matching in planar graphs with restrained degree, particularly those with all vertices having degree <= 3. After this reduction to degree <= 3 is performed, a second reduction where the 2-stars and 3-double-stars are removed is also performed before vertices are separated into clusters of size r and a maximum matching is calculated for each cluster.
